// Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

// Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

// Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.

// Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
// Output: 12
